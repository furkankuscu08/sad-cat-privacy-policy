<p>As we do not require account creation, there is no specific account data deletion process through us beyond uninstalling the app for locally stored data.</p>
<p><strong>5. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</strong></p>
<p>Sad Cat: Make Your Cat Happy is rated ESRB "Teen" (or an equivalent rating) and is intended for users aged 13 and older. We do not knowingly collect personal information directly from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe your child under 13 has provided us with personal information directly, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.</p>
<p>Our advertising partner, Google AdMob, may collect data (such as advertising identifiers, IP address, and usage data) as described in the "Information We Collect" section to serve advertisements to users of the Game. The collection and use of this data by Google AdMob are governed by Google's own privacy policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads?hl=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads?hl=en-US</a>. While our Game is targeted at users 13 and older, ads shown should be appropriate for this audience (e.g., Teen-rated content).</p>
<p>Parents and guardians are encouraged to supervise their children's online activities and to learn about the tools available from their mobile device and from Google to manage their child's privacy choices, including opting out of personalized advertising (see <strong>Section 6</strong>).</p>
<p>If you are a parent or guardian and have concerns about your child's (aged 13-17) use of the Game and data collection for advertising, please refer to Google's policies and your device's ad settings. You can also contact us at smart.lite.technologies@gmail.com with any general questions about our approach to privacy for our teen audience.</p>

<p><strong>7. SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect any information processed by the Game locally and to ensure our integration with third-party services like AdMob is done securely.
